---

## üîß Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. Next.js 16 Async Params in Dynamic Routes
**Problem:** Dynamic route params are now async Promises  
**Solution:**
```typescript
export default function ProgramPage({ params }: { params: Promise<{ slug: string }> }) {
  const [resolvedParams, setResolvedParams] = useState<{ slug: string } | null>(null);
  
  useState(() => {
    params.then(setResolvedParams);
  });
}
```

### 2. Optional Fields in TypeScript
**Problem:** `goal`, `raised`, and `features` are optional in ProgramCard type  
**Solution:** Added null coalescing operators:
```typescript
const totalGoal = programs.reduce((sum, p) => sum + (p.goal || 0), 0);
const progress = Math.round(((program.raised || 0) / (program.goal || 1)) * 100);
program.features?.slice(0, 3)
```

### 3. Image Error Handling
**Problem:** Some images may not exist  
**Solution:** Added onError handlers:
```typescript
<img
  src={program.image}
  onError={(e) => { e.currentTarget.src = '/Images/placeholder.jpg'; }}
/>
```

### 4. Client vs Server Components
**Problem:** Event handlers require client components  
**Solution:** Added `'use client'` directive to pages with interactivity
